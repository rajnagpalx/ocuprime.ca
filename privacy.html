<br>4.3. EXERCISE OF THE RIGHTS OF ACCESS, PORTABILITY AND DELETE OF DATA.
<br>
<br>To exercise the rights of access, portability and deletion of data described above, send us a verifiable request from the consumer, contacting us through our email: support@getocuprime.com. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State whom you authorize to act on your behalf, can submit a verifiable consumer request regarding your personal information. You can also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only submit a verifiable request for access or data portability twice in a 12-month period. The consumer's verifiable request must:
<br>
<br>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
<br>Describe your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it appropriately.
<br>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Completing a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use the personal information provided in a verifiable consumer application to verify the identity of the applicant or their authority to make the request.
<br>
<br>4.3.1. RESPONSE TIME AND FORMAT.
<br>
<br>We strive to respond to verifiable consumer requests within forty-five (45) days of receipt. If we need more time (up to a total of 90 days from the date of receipt of the request), we will inform you in writing of the reason and the extension period. The information we provide only covers the 12-month period prior to receipt of the consumer's verifiable request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons why we are unable to accommodate a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format for providing your personal information that is easily usable and that allows you to transmit the information from one entity to another without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will provide you with the reason for our decision and provide you with an estimate of the cost before completing your request.
<br>
<br>5. NON DISCRIMINATION.
<br>
<br>We do not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by CCPA, we will not:
<br>
<br>Deny you goods or services.
<br>Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including by granting discounts or other benefits, or by imposing penalties.
<br>Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services.
<br>Suggest to you that you may receive a different price or rate for the goods or services or a different level or quality of the same.
<br>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives allowed by the CCPA that may result in different prices, fees, or quality levels. Any financial incentive allowed by the CCPA that we offer will be reasonably related to the value of your personal information and will contain written terms that describe the material aspects of the program. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior consent, which you can revoke at any time.
